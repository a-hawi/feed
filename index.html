            <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the
               subjects I learned were current, if not more
               so, in the company I joined, I honestly feel
               I got every penny's worth. 
            </p>

            <p2>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined 
                the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an
                amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
                intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                successfully switched careers, working as a 
                Software Engineer at a VR startup."

            <p>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated.</p>

            <p2>"I started as a total newbie with virtually no
                coding skills. Now I work as a mobile engineer for 
                a big company. This was one of the best investments
                I've made in myself."</p2>

            <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>

            <p2>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line 
                of code. I needed some structure from the professionals
                who can help me learn programming step by step. I was 
                encouraged to enroll by aformer student of theirs who 
                can only say wonderful things about the program. The 
                entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for 
                assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was 
                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a 
                way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've 
                often referred to it during interviews as an example 
                of my development experience. It certainly helped me 
                land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving 
                multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p2>

            <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp 
                themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning 
                from their experiences was easy.
            </p>

            <p2>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress
                which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the 
                confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world 
                and present myself as a capable junior developer. The 
                standard is above the rest. You will get the personal 
                attention you need from an incredible community of 
                smart and amazing people"</p2>
